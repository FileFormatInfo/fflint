Badger is a tool for validating that all your files are in the correct format.

* Range - accepts a value within a range
    * `MIN-MAX`: anything between MIN and MAX (inclusive)
    * `MIN-`: at least MIN
    * `-MAX`: at most MAX
    * `VALUE`: exactly VALUE (i.e. MIN and MAX are the same)
* DecimalRange - similar to `Range`, but the values can be decimals
* Ratio - the ratio of two numbers
    * `X:Y`
