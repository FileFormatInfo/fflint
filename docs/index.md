Badger is a tool for validating that your files are in the correct format.

See [commands](/commands/index.html) for the list of supported file formats.

See [files](/files.html) for how to specify the files to check.

See [flags](/flags.html) for options that work on multiple file formats, as well as how to specify complicated options.
