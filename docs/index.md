h1: File Format Lint
---
FFLint is a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linter</a> for file formats. Are your files:

 * in the correct format?
 * with the correct extension?
 * with the correct image dimensions?
 * properly stripped of revealing metadata?
 * not too big or too small?
 * have decent names?

See [commands](/commands/index.html) for the list of supported file formats.

See [files](/files.html) for how to specify the files to check.

See [flags](/flags.html) for global flags that apply to multiple file formats, as well as details for complicated flag types like ranges and ratios.
