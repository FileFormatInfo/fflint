## Common Flags

These flags can be used with any [command](/commands/index.html).

Coming soon!

## Custom Flag Types

### Range

Ranges specify acceptable minimum and maximum values.

* The minimum and maximum values are separated by a dash.
* If either the minimum or maximum values are missing, there is no minimum/maximum.
* If there is just one value (and no dash), that is the only acceptable value (i.e. it is both the minimum and maximum)
* Ranges are inclusive.

<!-- LATER: examples -->

### Ratio

Ratios specify the acceptable proportions between two values.

* N:M
* Decimal number
